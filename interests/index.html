            <p>I have a deep appreciation for the art of filmmaking and storytelling. Watching movies and series allows me to immerse myself in diverse narratives, cultures, and emotions. Whether it's a thought-provoking indie film or a gripping TV series,
                I cherish the moments of escape and reflection they offer.</p>

            <h2>Guzheng</h2>
            <p>
                Music has always been a sanctuary for me, and the Guzheng holds a special place in my heart. This ancient Chinese zither, with its mesmerizing melodies and intricate playing techniques, speaks to my soul. I'm constantly captivated by its ethereal tones
                and the stories it tells through music. Whether I'm playing traditional pieces or experimenting with contemporary tunes, the Guzheng provides a unique bridge connecting my heritage to the present, allowing me to express emotions in ways
                words often cannot.
